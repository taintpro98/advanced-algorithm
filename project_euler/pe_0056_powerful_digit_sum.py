Project Euler 56 - Powerful Digit Sum
https://projecteuler.net/problem=56

A googol (10^100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros;
100^100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite
their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, a^b, where a, b < 100, what is the
maximum digital sum?
"""


def max_digit_sum(limit: int) -> int:
	return max(sum(map(int, str(a**b))) for a in range(1, limit) for b in range(1, limit))

# Answer
print(max_digit_sum(100))
